The Repository gives an Overview and Working code of Deep Learning based Image Classification. 
This code is designed to work in Google Collab but can also be used in Jupyter Notebook Locally with change in Dataset Input Directory.
The code mainly works with VGG16 deep learning model
Confusion matrix, required graphs (Train and Test Accuracy), Precisoon, Recall and F1 Score are obtained using this code.
For this code- we term Internal Testing= Validation.
